## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this portfolio website with the help of bootstrap and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size. Actually that doesnt matter here, as we are using bootstrap and let container do its job.

To change the color of any svg element, copy paste the svg contents from the file into the HTML, and use the fill property. Like

```css
svg {
  fill: whateverColorYouWant;
}
```

For the modal, you need to connect that to all of the images present in the PORTFOLIO section. One modal should be used and the image alone should be changed based on what the user clicks. Use fade and show animations extensively, and make sure it is responsive. You know what to do. 

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find the desktop and the mobile version of the design to work to.

The designs are in JPG static format. This will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. This should help train your eye to perceive differences in spacings and sizes.

You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized, so you just have to use the image tag and put in the source. You might have to adjust the width and height for the svg files alone.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file, which contains the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.
